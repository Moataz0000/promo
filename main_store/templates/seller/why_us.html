        <h2>This is just the beginning</h2>
        <p>The moment you sell on Promo is the moment you can start growing your Promo business. Once you launch your business, Promo has tools to help you take your business to the next level (or two).</p>
        <h2>Promotions and discount coupons</h2>
        <p>Customers want to save, and promotions are an incentive to make a purchase now. There are three types of promotions: money off, free shipping, and buy one get one free. You can also offer percentage discounts or cash off using digital coupons.</p>
